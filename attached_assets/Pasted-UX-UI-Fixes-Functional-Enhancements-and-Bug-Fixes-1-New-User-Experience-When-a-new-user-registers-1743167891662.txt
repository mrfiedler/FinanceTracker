UX/UI Fixes, Functional Enhancements, and Bug Fixes
1. New User Experience
When a new user registers, the platform should be completely empty, with:

No records in tables (Transactions, Quotes, Subscriptions, Contracts, Clients, etc.).

No pre-filled categories, banks, or financial data.

2. Convert Quote to Revenue
Once a Quote is set to Accepted, the user should be able to Convert to Revenue.

When clicking Convert to Revenue, a new modal should open, asking for:

Number of installments.

Amount per installment.

Due dates for each installment.

Once the user confirms, the Revenue should be created and added to the Finance page accordingly.

3. Finance Page Fixes
Finance modal is not working â†’ Fix all issues.

Finance Add Revenue (Client selection) is not working â†’ Allow users to select or create a new client.

Editing & Deleting Transactions: Users should be able to edit or delete both Expenses and Revenues directly from the Transactions table.

4. Notifications System Fixes
Users should be able to mark notifications as READ, and once marked, they should disappear completely.

"View All" in Notifications is not working:

Create a new Notifications page where users can see their notification history.

5. Client Management Fixes
Add Client Modal Enhancements:

Users should be able to type the business type and create new pre-made inputs.

Client Edit Bug:

When clicking Edit Client and closing it without modifications, the user gets stuck and can't navigate. Fix this issue.

"Expected number, received string" error:

Prevents users from creating inputs in any modal that includes Clients. Fix this across the entire platform.

6. Contracts Page Fixes
Remove "View" button in the Contracts section.

Download button should directly download the PDF contract stored for that contract.

Edit button is not working â†’ Ensure users can update contract details.

7. Quick Actions in Dashboard
Quick Action buttons are not working â†’ Remove them completely from the Dashboard.

8. Settings Page Fixes
Edit Profile Feature: Opens, but does not save changes (including Phone and Location). Fix this.

Change Password Functionality: User should be able to change their password successfully.

Sign Out Button: Currently non-functional â†’ Fix it to log the user out properly.

Company Info & Logo Upload:

Users should be able to save company details.

Upload logo should work properly.

Invite Team Member Button:

Change text to "Invite Team Member (Coming Soon)".

Company Page Functionalities Not Implemented:

Cover the tab with a dark overlay.

Add a notice in the center that says: "Coming Soon".

Sidebar Profile Data Unification:

Sidebar is displaying different Name, Email, and Profile Picture from the Settings page.

Ensure all profile information is consistent across the platform.

9. Global Search Bar Fix
