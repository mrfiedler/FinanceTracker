The web app needs the following improvements in CMS functionality, UI/UX fixes, database interactions, and modal functionalities to enhance usability and performance.

1. CMS Enhancements
Admins should be able to change user passwords from the CMS dashboard.

The CMS should remain visually consistent with the platform's aesthetic.

2. Notifications System
When a user logs in, their notifications should be empty by default.

Notifications should trigger when:

The user levels up.

A transaction is due.

A team member accepts an invitation to join their team.

3. Quests & Achievements
Users should not be able to manually complete quests; the system must handle completion automatically.

Replace completion buttons with ‚ÄúComing Soon‚Äù until rewards are finalized.

4. Dashboard Quick Actions
Remove points from quick actions (users should not level up by clicking them).

Ensure clicking each button opens the corresponding modal for data entry:

Add Revenue ‚Üí Finance page modal.

Add Expense ‚Üí Finance page modal.

Create Quote ‚Üí Quotes page modal.

Add Subscription ‚Üí Subscription page modal.

Change button order to:

Add Revenue, Add Expense, Create Quote, Add Subscription.

5. Finance Page & Settings Modal
Finance Settings modal:

Should not be pre-filled for new users.

Users should be able to add, edit, and delete categories/accounts.

All fields should be required for creation.

Add Revenue modal must be functional:

Users should be able to add inputs.

If the client does not exist, allow the user to create a client from the modal, and add it to the Clients database as a draft.

Revenue & Expense table:

Users should be able to edit existing records.

By default, the view should show the current month.

Implement a quick month switcher (e.g., swipe or dropdown).

6. Clients Page
Users should be able to edit client information after adding them.

7. Quotes Page
Create Quote modal:

Must allow users to create a client on the spot if the client does not exist.

The new client should be added to the Clients database as a draft.

Status selection should be available in the modal.

Fix functionality: Currently, quotes cannot be created from the modal.

8. Subscriptions Page
Add Subscription modal:

Must allow users to create a client if the client does not exist.

The new client should be added to the Clients database as a draft.

Users should be able to edit or delete subscriptions.

Fix functionality: Currently, subscriptions cannot be created from the modal.

9. Contracts Page
Linking contracts to quotes should be optional.

Users should be able to delete or edit contracts.

10. New User Experience
When a user registers, their profile should start empty, except for:

Name (from sign-up).

E-mail.

Username.

The profile picture should be consistent between the profile and sidebar.

The name and e-mail should also match across the platform.

11. Profile Settings
All buttons in the Profile Settings should be functional, except:

Invite Team Member and all buttons in the Payment tab.

Add ‚Äú(Coming Soon)‚Äù text to these buttons (e.g., Invite Team Member (Coming Soon)).

12. General UI/UX Fixes
Fix the main search bar in the header (currently non-functional).

Instructions for AI:
Implement the CMS functionality for password management.

Ensure all modals work correctly and allow dynamic data input.

Fix the quick action behavior in the dashboard.

Improve finance settings so users can fully manage their categories and accounts.

Enable user edits for subscriptions, clients, revenues, and expenses.

Ensure profile settings and notifications work as intended.
