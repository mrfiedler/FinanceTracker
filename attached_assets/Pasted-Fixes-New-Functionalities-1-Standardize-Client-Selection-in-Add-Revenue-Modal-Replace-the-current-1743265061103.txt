Fixes & New Functionalities
1. Standardize Client Selection in Add Revenue Modal
Replace the current flawed client selection method in the Add Revenue modal with the better one used in Create Quote & Add Subscription.

Ensure full consistency across all modals in the platform.

Goal: Users should experience a seamless and uniform way of selecting clients across different financial actions.

2. Rebuild the Tab System for Finance Modals
The current tab system needs to be redesigned with a clearer, more intuitive layout.

Ensure smooth navigation between sections (Category, Accounts, Transactions).

Improve UI clarity for adding, editing, and deleting items.

The new system should be consistent with the rest of the platform's UI/UX style.

3. Fix Navigation Freezing Issue After Deleting Accounts & Categories
Critical Bug:

When deleting a Category or Account, the app freezes and prevents further navigation.

This issue has persisted despite multiple fixes, meaning deeper debugging is required.

The user must remain inside the modal after deleting a category or account.

Prevent unexpected modal closures or app crashes.

Implement a success message after deletion.

Goal: Users should be able to delete categories/accounts without disrupting their workflow.

4. Fix Incorrect Account Name Display in Transactions Table
Bug:

When adding a Revenue or Expense, the transactions table incorrectly shows “Default” as the account name.

This is incorrect because “Default” is not an account created by the user.

Instead, the table must show the actual account name that the user selected.

Fix how accounts are mapped when displaying transactions.

Ensure that each row accurately reflects the correct category and account names.

Goal: Users should always see the correct data in their finance records—no phantom or incorrect entries.

Next Steps & Implementation Plan
Deep debug and permanently fix the navigation freezing issue.

Rebuild the Finance modal’s tab system for better UX/UI.

Replace the Add Revenue modal’s client selection method with the standard one used elsewhere.

Ensure the transaction table reflects the correct account names, not “Default.”

Test everything thoroughly to guarantee a smooth, bug-free experience.

End Goal: The Finance module will be fully functional, bug-free, and visually optimized, improving the overall user experience significantly.
