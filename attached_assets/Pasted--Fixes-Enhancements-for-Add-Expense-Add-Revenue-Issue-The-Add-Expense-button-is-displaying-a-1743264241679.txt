🛠 Fixes & Enhancements for Add Expense & Add Revenue
Issue:

The Add Expense button is displaying accounts and categories that are not in the Finance Settings modal.

The Accounts table shown in the Expense & Revenue modals does not match the accounts set in the Finance Settings modal.

When users try to add an Expense or Revenue, but haven’t set up a category or account, they should be able to add them directly from the modal.

Add Revenue modal is using a different client selection method compared to Create Quote and Add Subscription, which are better and should be used instead.

Deleting a category or account freezes the app and closes the modal. The user should remain in the modal instead.

🚀 Fixes & New Functionalities
1️⃣ Fix Data Sync Between Finance Settings & Add Expense/Add Revenue Modals
✅ Ensure that the categories and accounts shown in the Add Expense & Add Revenue modals match exactly with what’s in the Finance Settings modal.
✅ Remove any incorrect, outdated, or system-generated categories/accounts.

2️⃣ Allow Users to Add Categories & Accounts on the Fly
💡 New Feature:

If a user clicks Add Expense or Add Revenue, but hasn’t set up a Category or Account, allow them to add it directly from the modal without leaving the page.

After adding a new category or account, it should immediately be available for selection in the Expense/Revenue form.

Include a clear "+" button inside the Category and Account dropdowns to allow users to add new options instantly.

🎯 End Goal:
Users should never get stuck if they haven’t set up a category or account beforehand.

3️⃣ Standardize Client Selection in Add Revenue Modal
✅ Update the Add Revenue modal to use the same client selection method as Create Quote & Add Subscription.
✅ Ensure consistency across the platform for a seamless user experience.

4️⃣ Improve Delete Functionality for Categories & Accounts
💡 Fixes Needed:

When deleting a category or account, keep the user inside the Finance Settings modal instead of closing it.

Prevent app freezing after deletion.

Display a confirmation message after a successful delete (e.g., “Category successfully deleted”).

🎯 End Goal:
Deleting a category or account should be smooth and non-disruptive.

🚀 Final Implementation Requirements:
Thoroughly test the Expense & Revenue modals after implementing fixes.

Ensure the Finance Settings modal fully syncs with all related functionalities.

Optimize error handling so users receive proper feedback for all actions.

Once these updates are completed, the Finance module will work seamlessly with accurate data, flexible inputs, and a more intuitive experience! 🚀
